                <h3>What is Climate Change?</h3>
                <p>
                    Climate change refers to significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. While climate change is a natural phenomenon, scientific evidence shows that human activities have been the primary driver of an unprecedented rate of warming over the past century.

                    <h2>The Greenhouse Effect</h2>
                    <p>
                        The main cause of climate change is the <span class="hover-text" data-img="images/Greenhouse-gases.png">greenhouse effect</span>. 
                        Certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), trap heat from the sun, preventing it 
                        from escaping back into space. This leads to a warming of the planet. Human activities such as burning fossil fuels, 
                        deforestation, and industrial processes increase the concentration of these greenhouse gases.

                <h3>Effects of Climate Change</h3>
                <p>
                    The effects of climate change are far-reaching and varied, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rising sea levels due to <span class="hover-text" data-img="images/icecap.gif">melting polar ice caps and glaciers</span></li>
                        <li>More frequent and severe weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves</li>
                        <li>Disruption of ecosystems and loss of biodiversity</li>
                        <li>Impacts on agriculture and food security</li>
                        <li>Health risks due to heat stress, waterborne diseases, and poor air quality</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>What Can Be Done?</h3>
                <p>
                    Addressing climate change requires collective action at all levels, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reducing greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning to renewable energy sources like solar and wind</li>
                        <li>Improving energy efficiency in homes, buildings, and transportation</li>
                        <li>Protecting and restoring forests, wetlands, and other natural carbon sinks</li>
                        <li>Supporting policies and initiatives that promote sustainable practices</li>
                        <li>Educating and empowering individuals to make environmentally-friendly choices</li>
                    </ul>
