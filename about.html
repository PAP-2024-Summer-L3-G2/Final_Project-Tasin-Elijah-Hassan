                <h3>What is Climate Change?</h3>
                <p>
                    Climate change refers to significant changes in global temperatures and weather patterns over time. While climate change is a natural phenomenon, scientific evidence shows that human activities have been the primary driver of an unprecedented rate of warming over the past century.

                    <h2>The Greenhouse Effect</h2>
                    <p>
                        The main cause of climate change is the <span class="hover-text" data-img="images/aboutPage/Greenhouse-gases.png"><b>greenhouse effect</b></span>. 
                        Certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), trap heat from the sun, preventing it 
                        from escaping back into space. This leads to a warming of the planet. Human activities such as burning fossil fuels, 
                        deforestation, and industrial processes increase the concentration of these greenhouse gases.
